# School Management System

A full-stack School Management System with dedicated portals for Admins, Teachers, and Students. Built with Node.js/Express, MySQL, React 19, and Tailwind CSS.

---

## Features

- JWT authentication with role-based access control (Admin / Teacher / Student)
- Multi-school support — all data is scoped to a school
- Admin portal: manage schools, users, classes, subjects, teacher assignments, and student enrollments
- Teacher portal: record attendance and grades per class
- Student portal: view own attendance and grades (auto-scoped on the backend)
- Auto-initializes the database schema on server startup

## Database Schema

| Table            | Description                                              |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `schools`        | School records (name, director, email, address)          |
| `users`          | All users with roles: `admin`, `teacher`, `student`      |
| `classes`        | Classes per school (e.g. "Grade 10A")                    |
| `subjects`       | Subjects per school (e.g. "Mathematics")                 |
| `class_subjects` | Assigns a teacher to a subject within a class            |
| `student_classes`| Enrolls a student into a class                           |
| `attendance`     | Daily attendance per student/class (present/absent/late) |
| `grades`         | Grade per student/subject/class/term                     |

All foreign keys use `ON DELETE CASCADE`.

## Setup & Running

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Docker with Docker Compose (or MySQL running locally)

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/school-management-system.git
cd school-management-system
```

### 2. Configure the backend

```bash
cd server
cp .env.example .env   # or create .env manually
```

`.env` file:

```env
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_USER=school_app
DB_PASSWORD=local_school_password
DB_NAME=school_management
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=local_root_password
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

Replace the example passwords and JWT secret in `.env`. From `server/`, start MySQL and wait until it is ready:

```bash
docker compose up -d --wait mysql
```

MySQL is exposed on `127.0.0.1:3306` and stores data in the `mysql_data` named volume. Port 3306 must be available. Keep `DB_NAME=school_management` because `schema.sql` uses that database name. The application connects using the non-root `DB_USER` account.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev   # starts on http://localhost:3600
```

Compose creates the database on first initialization; the server creates the tables on startup. Run `docker compose down` from `server/` to stop MySQL while preserving its data. Database credentials are applied only when the data volume is first initialized; changing `.env` does not update existing MySQL users.

### 3. Run the frontend

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev   # starts on http://localhost:5173
```

The Vite dev server proxies all `/api` requests to `http://localhost:3600`, so no CORS configuration is needed.

---

## Authentication

All protected routes require a `Bearer` token in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
```

The token is returned from `POST /api/auth/login` and stored in `localStorage` by the frontend. The Axios instance in `client/src/api/axios.js` attaches it automatically to every request.
